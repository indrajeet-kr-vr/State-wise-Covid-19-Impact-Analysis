# State-wise-Covid-19-Impact-Analysis
 Covid Analytics: Leveraging 'df_covid' and 'df_vacc' for comprehensive analysis. Descriptive stats, Recovery/Mortality rates, Top 10 state barplots for active cases/deaths, gender-based vaccination pie charts, Top 5 vaccinated states barplot. Utilized multi-indexing and column renaming for clarity.
### Overview
In this project, I leveraged two DataFrames, 'df_covid' and 'df_vacc', to conduct a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 data. I utilized descriptive statistics functions (info() and describe()) to summarize the datasets and extracted specific records for in-depth analysis.

Key analyses included:

Calculating Recovery and Mortality rates for each state.
Visualizing the Top 10 states with the highest active cases using seaborn barplots.
Displaying state-wise death reports through barplots.
Additional methodologies applied:

Implemented multi-indexing for advanced data handling.
Renamed columns for improved clarity using the rename function.
Analyzed vaccination percentages by gender and visualized the results with matplotlib pie charts.
Concluded the project by identifying and visualizing the Top 5 vaccinated states in India using a barplot
